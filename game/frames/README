This is an awesome planet simulator animation by Joey Bonitati

The planets Earth, Mercury, Venus, and Mars are going for a jog in space along with the Sun and a passing-by asteroid.
The planets have two-way multiframe sprites, and they turn around every time they pass the sun! Wow!
All sprites in this project were made by Joey Bonitati.
